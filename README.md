# Repository for final project


This project was part of the "Developing AI Applications with Python and Flask" module in the Full Stack Coursera course. During this module, I developed a function called Emotion Detector. This function interfaces with an external AI API to analyze text and return a score for each emotion detected, as well as identify the most dominant emotion.

Additionally, I implemented routers to serve the HTML content on a server. I also created a router to manage user requests and communicate with the external API efficiently.
